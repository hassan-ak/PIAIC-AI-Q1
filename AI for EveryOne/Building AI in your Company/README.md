## 3. AI Transformation Playbook

- What is a Playbook?
  - Playbooks are vital to an organization, from business to professional sports teams. Simply put, they help organizations plan and strategize tactics that will ultimately bring them success. Its vital for organizations to stay a step ahead of their industry and create playbooks for aspects that will impact their bottom line, such as recruiting to talent.
- AI transformation Playbook

  - Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
    - More important for the initial project to succeed rather than be the most valuable
    - Show traction within 6-12 months
    - Can be in-house or outsourced
  - Build an in-house AI team

    ![](../snaps/10.JPG)

    - Bu = Business Unit
    - AI function can be under CTO, CIO, CDO or CAIO etc.

  - Provide Broad AI training

    - Resources

      - Online courses
      - Books
      - Curate rather than create content

        ![](../snaps/11.JPG)

  - Develop an AI strategy

    - Leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry sector
    - Design strategy aligned with the “Virtuous Cycle of AI”

      ![](../snaps/12.JPG)

    - AI needs to be specialized or verticalized to your industry sector
    - Don’t compete with giants
    - Consider creating a data strategy
      - Strategic data acquisition
      - Unified data ware house
    - Create network effects and platform advantages
      - In industries with “winner take all” dynamics, AI can be an accelerator

  - Develop internal and external communication
    - Investor relations
    - Government relations
    - Consumer / user education
    - Talent / recruitment
    - Internal communications

## 4. Pitfalls of AI

- A pitfall to avoid
  - Don’t
    - Expect AI to solve every thing
    - Hire 2-3 ML engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases
    - Expect the AI project to work the first time
    - Expect traditional planning process to apply without changes
    - Think you need superstar AI engineers before you can do anything
  - Do
    - Be realistic about what AI can and cannot do given limitations of technology, data & engineering resources
    - Pair engineering talent with business talent & work cross-functionally to find feasible & valuable project
    - Plan for AI development to be an iterative process, with multiple attempts needed to succeed
    - Work with AI team to establish timeline estimates, mile stones, kPIs, etc
    - Keep building the team, but get going with the team you have

## 5. Taking the First Step

- Some initial steps you can take
  - Get friends to learn about AI
    - This course
    - Reading group
  - Start brainstorming projects
    - No project is too small
  - Hire a few ML / DS people to help
  - Hire or appoint an AI leader (VP AI, CAIO, etc.)
  - Discuss with CEO / Board possibilities of AI transformation
    - Will your company be much more valuable and / or more effective if it were good at AI?

## 7. Survey of AI Techniques

- The value today of unsupervised learning is a lot smaller than value created through supervised learning
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
  - Clustering
    - Group data on common idea
- Transfer learning
  - Learn task A and use knowledge to help on task B
  - This can be done as first layers are almost same
- Reinforcement learning
  - Only data is given, no labels nothing
  - Reward based
- GANs (Generative Adversarial Network)
  - Created due to self-learning model
  - Synthesize new image from scratch
  - Used in animation industry
- Knowledge Graphs
