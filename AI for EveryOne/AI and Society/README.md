## 1. Realistic view of AI

- Goldi locks rules for AI
  - Too optimistic: sentient / super intelligent. AI killer robots coming soon
  - Too pessimistic: AI cannot do everything, so an AI winter is coming
  - Just right: AI cannot do everything but will transform industries.
- Limitations of AI

  - Lack of data
  - Explain-ability is hard
  - Performance limitation
  - Biased through biased data
  - Adversarial attack

## 2. Discrimination and Bias

- AI learning unhealthy stereotypes
- Why bias matters
  - Hiring tool that discriminated against women
  - Facial recognition working better for light-skinned than dark-skinned individuals
  - Bank loan approvals
  - Toxic effect of reinforcing unhealthy stereotypes
- Combating bias

  - Technical Solutions
    - “zero out” the bias in words
    - Use less biased and / or more inclusive data
  - Transparency and / or auditing processes
  - Diverse workforce
    - Create less biased applications

## 3. Adversarial Attacks on AI

- Adversarial Attacks
  - Spam Filter
    - Process content an decide spam or not
    - If we write a mail with diverse data contain spam and other it will confuse AI
  - Object recognition --- minor perturbation
    - If we change minor detail in the pixel of the picture it might not be visible to human eye but can affect performance of AI
- Physical attacks
  - self-driving car
    - If the stop signs on some places is slightly damaged by using some other sticker on it, human eye might detect it but AI can’t.
  - Face recognition
    - It can be possible to fool AI by using some clothing or something else
- Adversarial Defense

  - Defense do exist, but incur some cost
  - Similar to spam vs anti-spam, we may be in an arms race for some applications

## 4. Adverse uses of AI

- Deep Fakes --- Buzz feed website
  - Synthesize video of people doing things they never did
- Undermining of democracy and privacy
  - Oppressive surveillance
- Generating fake comments
- Spam vs anti-spam and fraud vs anti-fraud

## 5. AI and Developing Economies

- Every time there is a major technical disruption such as of AI, it gives us a chance to remake the world. AI is a very advanced technology, yes affecting both developed economies and developing economies.
  - Developing economies gradually moved up the ladder
  - Lower end ladder is susceptible to automation such as agriculture
  - Trampoline to move higher rungs
    - Leapfrog
      - Mobile Phones
      - Mobile payments
      - Online education
- How developing countries can build AI

  - US and China are leading, but all AI communities are still immature
  - Focus on AI to strengthen a country’s vertical industries
  - Public-private partnerships to accelerate development
  - Invest in education

## 6. AI and Jobs

- Regular jobs will be displaced in near future but a boom to AI jobs will come
- Solutions to counter AI impact on jobs
- Conditional basic income: provide a safety net by incentivize learning

  - Lifelong learning
  - Political solutions

## 7. Conclusion

- What is AI?
- Building AI Projects
- Building AI in your Company
- AI and Society
