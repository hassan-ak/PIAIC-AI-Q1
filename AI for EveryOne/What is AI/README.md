## 6. What is Data?

- What enables machine learning to work so well
  - Data
- Tabular form of data

| Size of house | No. of rooms | Price |
| :-----------: | :----------: | :---: |
|               |              |       |
|               |              |       |
|               |              |       |
|       A       |      A       |   B   |

- Columns known as feature
- Rows knows as entry
- A is input
- B is output
- If three columns mean three features
- Data is unique to every business

[Top of Page](README.md#what-is-ai)

## 7. Acquiring Data?

## 10. Intro to Deep Learning

![](../snaps/3.JPG)

- Circles are nodes / neurons
- We can only control input or output layer
- Internal layers are hidden
- Densely connected network
  - If neurons of one layer are connected with all the neurons of next layer then known as densely connected network.
- Neural network has nothing to do with actual human brain
