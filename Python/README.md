# Python

Before Learning about python we need to know about some other things first.

## 1. Programming with Python

**Difference b/w Software and Hardware.**

- Software
  - A Software is a program or set of programs written using programming languages.
  - Software is responsible for running hardware.
  - All operating systems are also softwares.
  - Operating system controls and runs all hardware
  - All the tangible componets of a computer system are hardware
    - Keyboard
    - Mouse
    - Moniter
    - Hard Disk
    - Ram
- Hardware
  - All the intangible componets of a computer system are hardware
    - All Applications running
    - Microsft Office
    - Chrome

## 2. Compiler and Interpreter

| Compiler                                                                                                         | Interpreter                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scans the entire program and translate it as a whole into machine code.                                          | Translate program one statement at a time                                                                        |
| It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. | It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but overall execution time is slower                     |
| Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hense requires more memory                    | No intermediate object code is generated, hence memory efficient                                                 |
| It genrates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard       | Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy. |
| Programming language like C, C++ use compilers                                                                   | Programming language like Python, Ruby use interepreters.                                                        |

## 3. What is Python?

Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high level, and interpreted programming language. It supports the Object Oriented Programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provide lots of high level data structures

**Why Python?**

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Respberry Pi, etc)
- Python has a simple syntax similar to English.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way, or a functional way.

**Data Sciences and Artificial Intelligence**

- Python is the fastest adoptable language in data science and artificial intelligence.
- One of the most famous machine learning libraries produced by Google `Tensorflow` is python based

## 4. Versions of Python

There are two versions of python

- Python 2
- Python 3

being the latest we use Python 3
